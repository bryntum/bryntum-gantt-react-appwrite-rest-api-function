# ‚ö° Bryntum Gantt Node.js REST API Appwrite Function 

## Appwrite collections needed

A database with two collections: tasks and dependencies.The tasks collection needs to have [attributes](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/databases/collections#attributes) that represent the¬†[Bryntum Gantt Task Model fields](https://bryntum.com/products/gantt/docs/api/Gantt/model/TaskModel#fields), which represent a Bryntum Gantt task. The dependencies collection needs to have attributes that represent the [Bryntum Gantt Dependency Model fields](https://bryntum.com/products/gantt/docs/api/Gantt/model/DependencyModel#fields), which represent a Bryntum Gantt dependency.

## üîí Environment Variables needed

No environment variables required.

- PROJECT_ID

- DEPENDENCIES_COLLECTION_ID


## Authentication

Requires a secret JSON Web Token, created using Appwrite [JWT authentication](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/auth/jwt#jwt), added to the request's "authorization" header. This authentication is added so that only logged in users can view or change data. The client side Bryntum Gantt needs to set up Appwrite authentication so that when a user logs in, a session will be created using the Appwrite client SDK. This allows you to generate a JWT using the session and add it to the "authorization" header when making requests to this function.

## üß∞ Usage

### GET

Returns tasks and dependencies data using the [load response structure](https://bryntum.com/products/gantt/docs/guide/Gantt/data/crud_manager_project#load-response-structure) expected by a Bryntum Gantt Crud Manager load request.

### POST

Handles POST requests from Bryntum Gantt Crud Manager sync requests that include changes for all the linked data stores in a single request, which has a specific¬†[sync request structure](https://bryntum.com/products/gantt/docs/guide/Scheduler/data/crud_manager_in_depth#sync-request-structure). The response has a specific [sync response structure](https://bryntum.com/products/gantt/docs/guide/Gantt/data/crud_manager_project#sync-response-structure) that sends the new `id` of a record created in Appwrite to the client side Bryntum Gantt so that the Bryntum Gantt has the correct `id` for the record.
